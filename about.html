        This website was created as part of my CSC 340 Static Web App assignment.
        The goal of this project is to design a simple and clean gallery of fictional
        characters using basic HTML and CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
        I chose the theme of female superheroes because they are strong, inspiring,
        and each character has a unique story and personality. I feel empowered by the characters. I also wanted the
        design of the website to feel soft and pink (my favourite color) but still matching the
        powerful superhero theme.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this project, I practiced creating multiple web pages, adding
        navigation links, organizing images and designing a neat layout that is
        easy for users to read and explore.
